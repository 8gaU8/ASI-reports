Original image was loaded from the ENVI format with the interleave
format BIL. The image was saved with the interleave format BIP. The
Python script is shown in Code \ref{code:save-bip}.

Function \texttt{load\_spectral\_image} in \ref{code:save-bip} is
defined in Code \ref{code:load-envi}.

The header file of the BIP image is shown in Code
\ref{code:header-bip}. There are two changes from original one:
description and interleave method.

The preview by FreeLook is shown in Figure \ref{fig:bip-preview}.
